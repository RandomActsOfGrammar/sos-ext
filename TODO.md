* We might add more translations:
  + Coq

* We can add some built-in types:
  + Polymorphic contexts where we can choose the key and value types,
    with lookup, containment, and non-containment relations
  + Polymorphic lists, along with some relations for them like append
  + Pairs, maybe, though they might not be useful once we have
    contexts, though we might just make contexts be lists of pairs
